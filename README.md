A user-friendly decision support platform that integrates GIS, UAVs, AI, and remote sensing to help farmers and land managers make data-driven decisions.

The Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) is developed within the CHAMELEON project to empower farmers, agronomists, and land managers with actionable insights for smarter, more sustainable agriculture.

ADSS combines state-of-the-art technologies—Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3D Digital Twin modeling, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and AI-driven analytics—to deliver clear, interactive, and practical tools for agricultural decision-making.

Key capabilities include:

🌱 Crop Monitoring – track growth, stress, and development through vegetation indices

🍇 Vineyard Management – assess water stress, detect vines, and optimize irrigation

🐄 Livestock Monitoring – detect herd movement and cow lameness in near real-time

🌍 Soil & Vegetation Analysis – create precision soil zones, monitor tree and forest health

🛰 Geospatial Insights – leverage UAV and satellite data for field-level analytics

📊 Reporting – generate automated PDF reports with geospatial data, metrics, and visualizations

ADSS is seamlessly integrated with the Drone Innovation Platform (DIP), which executes processing workflows (“bundles”). The ADSS focuses on visualization, decision support, and user interaction, providing a game-like, intuitive interface that lowers the learning curve for end-users.

By combining User-Centered Design with Agile Development, ADSS ensures usability, flexibility, and adaptability to evolving agricultural needs.
